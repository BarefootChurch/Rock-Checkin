This app hosts an embedded web browser for use with our checkin app. A native app is required to allow access to local printers that are inside an organization's firewall. It also caches data locally to improve the performance of our checkin.

Instructions to connect to the demo server for functional testing:

A username may be required half way through configuration
Username: admin
Password: admin

When the app loads it will ask for a URL to configure with.
Check-in Address: http://rock.rocksolidchurchdemo.com/checkin

Once the main page loads it will ask for how the kiosk should be configured:
Kiosk Device: Main Campus - Central Kiosk
Check-in Configuration: Weekly Service Check-in Area
Check-in Area(s): Check-in Test Area

Click OK, at this point is when the login page may come up (admin/admin).

At this point you should be at the main check-in screen.

1) Tap “Check In” and enter the partial phone number “3322” and press Search.

2) Select the Decker Family

3) Select the individuals you want to test-check-in, for example Noah.

4) Select one of the rooms, such as the “Kittens” room.

5) Select the 4:30 service and press “Check-in”.

6) You should then see a status screen showing that Noah was checked in. You will probably see a note about the printer not being connected, that is normal since this is the demo server.

7) Tap Done or wait for auto-refresh to the main check-in screen.
